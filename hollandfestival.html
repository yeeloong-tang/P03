          Gap in Pre-Engagement </br>
          The festival lacked a touchpoint that effectively
          engaged users prior to the event, limiting their ability to explore
          and anticipate their festival experience. This gap presented an opportunity
          for a design intervention to enhance the audience's pre-engagement
          journey.
